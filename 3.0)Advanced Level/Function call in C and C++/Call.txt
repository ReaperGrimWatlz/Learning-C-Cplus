<>Call by value:
>>It is a method of passing arguments to the function.
>>When we pass a variable by value it makes a copy of the variable.
>>Before passing to the function.
>>Changes to the arguments in the  function will remain in function only.
>>It will not be affected outside the function.
<>Call by reference:
>>It is another method of passing arguments to the function.
>>This method copies the address of the argument instead of value.
>>Changes made to the argument inside a function can affect them outside.
>>In this we need to declare the arguments as pointer type.
